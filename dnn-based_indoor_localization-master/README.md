# DNN-Based Indoor Localization
This repository is for the implementation of advanced DNN models for scalable
indoor localization with Wi-Fi fingerprinting. In this work, we are to exploit
single-input and multi-output models<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref"
href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> for flexible control of loss weights for different
outputs; they are natural extensions
of
[the multi-lable classifier](https://github.com/kyeongsoo/indoor_localization/blob/master/python/scalable_indoor_localization.py) that
was investigated
in [the previous work](https://github.com/kyeongsoo/indoor_localization).

of
[multi-input and multi-output models](https://keras.io/getting-started/functional-api-guide/#multi-input-and-multi-output-models).
